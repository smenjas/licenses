# Free Software & Open Source Licenses

Free software and open source licenses fall along a spectrum between permissive
and restrictive.

## Restrictive

Restrictive licenses place restrictions on software distributors.  For example,
the GNU GPL licenses require distributors to release the source code, with any
changes, to their users.

- The Linux kernel project uses version 2 of the GPL.
- Version 3 of the GPL disallows digital rights management (DRM).
- Restrictive licenses like the GPL are also called copyleft.

## Permissive

Permissive licenses include the BSD and ISC licenses, as well as the Lesser GPL
(LGPL), for example.  They allow people to distribute your software within
their own proprietary software, without being required to release their changes
as open source.
